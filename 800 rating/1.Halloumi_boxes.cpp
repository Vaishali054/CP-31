// Theofanis is busy after his last contest, as now, he has to deliver many halloumis all over the world. 
// He stored them inside n boxes and each of which has some number ai written on it.

// He wants to sort them in non-decreasing order based on their number, however, his machine works in a 
// strange way. It can only reverse any subarray of boxes with length at most k

// Find if it's possible to sort the boxes using any number of reverses.

// Input

// Each test case consists of two lines.
// The first line of each test case contains two integers n
//  and kâ€” the number of boxes and the length of the maximum reverse that Theofanis can make.

// 5
// 3 2
// 1 2 3
// 3 1
// 9 9 9
// 4 4
// 6 4 2 1
// 4 3
// 10 3 830 14
// 2 1
// 3 1

//Output
// YES
// YES
// YES
// YES
// NO
